		<h1>Review: Modern React with Redux</h1>
		This is a review of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/"> Modern React with Redux </a> offered on Udemy by Stephen Grider.
	I walked into this knowing very little about webpack, babel, react, redux or  ES6.
JSX. The first third is pure react, in which you build a functional <a href="../youtube">youtube browser</a>.
The last two thirds is Redux, in which you build a <a href="../booklist"> booklist app</a>, 
<a href="../weather">5-day weather sparklines app</a> and a <a href="../comments">functional comments board</a>. 

<h2>Take-home Messages</h2>

<ul>
	<li> The emphasis in this class is on doing things from scratch the wrong way, to really understand the parts and how to debug.</li>
	<li> It includes a hands-on walkthrough of how to break up a UI into components, which puts react in the overall context of a project workflow. </li>
	<li> During the class I used the IntelliJ editor with the JSX Harmony plugin. This made dealing with JSX really easy.</li>
	<li> Key principles: <ul>
		<li> “Controlled Component” is bound from state. </li>
		<li> “Downward Data Flow” </li>
	</ul> </li>
	<li> React is really simple and easy to use, nearly as simple as knockout. <ul>
		<li> React is much simpler than backbone in terms of number of concepts. </li>
		<li> Greatly helped by a few tricks that are possible because of ES6. </li>
		<li> React is most complex than knockout, but the increased flexibility seems worth it. </li>
		<li> The main downside is that you have to write in ES6, which means for the time being that you need to have a build step, an debugging in the browser is harder. </li>
		<li> In a simple example the course manages to show why react (and knockout) are not enough for a complex app.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li> Redux is... quite surprising, but simple when you understand it. <ul>
		<li> It is a way of maintaining global state that is composed of immutable data that can only be updated through partial replacements of sub-parts through events. </li>
		<li> I have never heard a decent description of redux </li>
		<li> Goes into details of core mechanics of redux.  </li>
		<li> Instructor claims that properly teaching redux is one of the most challenging things he has tried to do. </li>
		<li> He does a pretty good job, and I came away feeling pretty good about redux </li>
		<li> Not only is redux more complicated, it is quickly evolving, and often has incomplete or outdated docs </li>
	</ul> </li>	
	<li> Sometimes painfully slow description of events, state, constructors and functional programming, which I pretty much got on the first explanation, but which he went through at length.</li>
	<li>	I ended up watching at least half the videos at 2x speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Key Concepts </h2>
<ul>
	<li> react component/dumb component/component</li>
	<li> redux container/smart component </li>
	<li> webpack </li>
	<li> redux reducer </li>
	<li> redux state vs react state </li>
	<li> redux middleware,  redux promise </li> 
	<li> React router, browserHistory vs hashHistory </li>
	<li> react reducer, hot reloading, ES6 syntax </li>
	<li> marked library for markdown </li>
</ul>
